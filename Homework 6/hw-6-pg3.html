            <h3>Terms of Agreement:</h3>
            <p>This is just going to be a rambled on short speech of all of the wacky terms and conditions that people usually have to read/skip over. There is nothing in this paragraph except absolute jargon. The only relatively applicable thing even remotely close to a terms and conditions soliloquy is you have to contact me if you are struggling with anything. Mental health is a huge topic of discussion that many people avoid, and I would like to help anyone if I can. I am an awkward dork who is always there. Thank you for reading. Let me know if you have questions. These are the terms and conditions.</p>
