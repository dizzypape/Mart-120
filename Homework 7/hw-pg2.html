          <h2>A Girl Named Izzy</h2>
            <span class="strawberry"><p>There was a young girl, let's call her <i>Dizzy</i>.</p>
            <p>One day she woke up late, and her hair was all <i>frizzy</i>,</p>
            <p>But she said, "Let's <i>fly</i>!"</p>
            <p>Because time was passing <i>by</i>.</p>
            <p>She didn't think twice about living her <i>life</i>.</p>
            <p>And she didn't seem to care about her family <i>strife</i>.</p>
            <p>All she knew was here and <i>now</i>,</p>
            <p>If only I could be her, someway, <i>somehow</i>.</p>
            <p>Instead, I wallow in <i>sorrow</i>,</p>
            <p>Because it's happiness I cannot <i>borrow</i>.</p>
            <p>So I keep to myself and watch the <i>sunset</i>,</p>
            <p>Because tomorrow's a new day, and I haven't given up, <i><u>yet</u></i>.</p>
